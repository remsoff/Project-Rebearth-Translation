# Project Rebearth - community translations

This is the repository for Project Rebearth community translations. With your help we can make the game available in as many languages as possible, making the game as accessible as possible.

## How to contribute

### Update existing languages

If you found mistakes or want to improve existing translations, you can suggest changes. Either clone the repository locally, make your changes and push a commit with the new changes. Or use the online file editor on GitHub to suggest changes directly from the browser. Your change will be reviewed and when approved, added to the game!

### Add a new language

If you want to add a new language to the game, great! Clone the repository and copy the en.json file. rename it using the 2-letter language code of the language you want to add. Go through the file and translate as many of the keys as possible. it is okay to commit a partially incomplete file to this repository, but only fully translated and verified languages will be added to the game.

### Verify a language

Using the Issues tab on GitHub, give your seal of approval for a certain language. Go through the latest version of the translation you want to verify, and leave any remarks or comments in the appropriate issue for that language.

## Some guidelines

- The JSON will contain key - value pairs written like 'key': 'value'. Only translate the values.
- Keep the JSON structure intact. don't change or remove keys, or the order. That might break the file and the translation.
- Test that your JSON is valid. A good code editor will warn you if the JSON format is broken. You can also find plenty of [online JSON validators](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=validate+json+online&atb=v347-1&ia=answer)
- Use natural, game-appropriate language. If you are unsure about where a certain translation will be used, ask in Discord.
- Don't use automated translations without reviewing it.
